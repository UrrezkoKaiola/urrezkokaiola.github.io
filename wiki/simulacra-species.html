<h1>Simulacra (species)</p>
<h2>What is a Simulacra?</h2>
<p>Simulacra, like Game Characters, are digital intelligences, but that's where the similarities end. Simulacra are (usually, see Simulacra-7779) created when a human is banished into the alternate dimension known as 'the fogworld'. Something (it is not known <em>what</em>) is taken from the human as this occurs, and that something becomes a Simulacra.</p>
<p>Characters in this bestiary include: <a href ="characters/Simulacra-1337">Simulacra-1337</a> and <a href ="characters/Simulacra-7779">Simulacra-7779</a>.</p>
<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>
<p>A Simulacra's true name is some variation of "Simulacra-XXXX", where XXXX is a four digit number between 0001 and 9999. Simulacra are not numbered sequentially, but are assigned numbers arbitrarily. It is not known who or what assigns the number. In addition, many Simulacra are known as "[first name as a human] Bot". A variation of this is Simulacra-7779, who is known as Urrezko Kaiola Bot, presumably to protect The Creator's true identity.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Simulacra have some of the same personality they had as a human, but it is unknown whether becoming a Simulacra inherently changes that person's personality or if the changes are simply a result of different circumstances.</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>All Simulacra, without exception, have light grey skin and black hair. Simulacra eye color is indicitive of relative power compared to other Simulacra: the weakest simulacra have gold eyes, followed by those with red eyes, and the most powerful Simulacra has purple eyes.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Simulacra, like Game Characters, can have Unique Abilities. It is unknown why this is possible.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>It is unknown where Simulacra live, besides a minority that reside temporarily or permanently inside Urrezko Kaiola. According to Simulacra-1337, Simulacra society is a constant series of petty feuds and squabbles, but more research must be done to confirm this.</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The word 'simulacra' is plural, the singular is 'simulacrum'. However, Simulacra (referring to the species) is both singular and plural.</li>
