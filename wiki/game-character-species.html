<h1>Game Character (species)</p>
<h2>What is a Game Character?</h2>
<p>Game Characters are the primary inhabitants of the Urrezko Kaiola world. Game Characters are a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">Artificial intelligence</a>, which were created by The Creator of Urrezko Kaiola for unknown reasons and by unknown means.</p>
<h2>"Biology"</h2>
<p>There are three major parts to a Game Character: The Stimulus Bank, the Liveloader, and the Output Bank.</p>
<h3>Stimulus Bank</h3>
<p>This apparatus controls every major stimulus, or input, a Game Character can recieve, and it is mostly the same for every character. It takes up about 8 Gigabytes of file space.</p>
<h3>Output Bank</h3>
<p>This apparatus contains the statistics, Unique Ability, appearance, and purpose of the character. This part varies in size from 10 Gigabytes to 34 Gigabytes.</p>
<h3>Liveloader</h3>
<p>Essentially the 'brain' of the character, not much is known about what goes on in the Liveloader. Liveloaders take up between 14 and 17 <b>Terabytes</b> of space.</p>
<h2>Subspecies</h2>
<h3>Humanoid</h3>
<p>This is the major subspecies of Game Character, and comprise most of their population. These characters have a human form, and don't deviate much in form or personality from Humans, at least on shallow exploration.</p>

<h3>Feline</h3>
<p>The second-largest subspecies of Game Character, these Characters have traits like cats, to some degree. Most Feline Game Characters have cat ears and/or a tail (not always visible). They also have some cat-like instincts and personality traits, but I would prefer to not go into that, thank you very much.</p>
