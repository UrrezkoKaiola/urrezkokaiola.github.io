<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Ilargia is a serious, no-nonsense, devoted servant. She rarely gets involved with humor, and reacts with indignity to jokes. The only person to make her show emotions is <a href="erlojua">Erlojua</a> but even then only briefly.</p>
<h2>Story</h2>
<p>Ilargia is introduced destroying <a href="Simulacra-1337">Ross Bot</a>'s tank with her unique ability, and killing <a href="lehen">Lehen</a>, <a href="bigarren">Bigarren</a>, and <a href="hirugarren">Hirugarren</a>, for their occupation of the City.</p>
<p>Initially she welcomes the party, but as she's about to leave she recieves a call from Erlojua, and changes her mind, deciding to attack the party. Ilargia fights the party 3 more times during the chapter, the last time inside the Hands of Time's mansion.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Ilargia's <a href="../unique-ability">Unique Ability</a> allows her to stop the flow of time temporarily. In battle, this manifests as the party being frozen while Ilargia continues to take turns. Outside of battle, this causes Ilargia to appear to teleport and/or move at incredibly fast speeds.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>Erlojua</h3>
<p>Ilargia is Erlojua's devoted servant, and together they make up the Hands of Time. Offending one is a sure-fire way to earn the rage of the other. They're also romantically involved, although the exact nature of this is unclear.</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ilargia is the only character to have a theme written in all caps ("DU MUNDUA"). The title means "THE WORLD" which is a reference to <em>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</em> character Dio Brando's special ability of the same name, which also stops time.</li>
<li>Ilargia and Erlojua have acessories matching each other's hair colors.</li>
