<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Tximista is cripplingly shy, but also capable of a lot of harm. She is also an archetypical <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">yandere</a>; single-mindedly devoted to the object of her affections (<a href="Lehiakide">Lehiakide</a>) and violent when those affections are refused or her percieved chances threatened.</p>
<h2>Story</h2>
<p>Tximista, along with <a href="Basati">Basati</a> and <a href="Zelatatu">Zelatatu</a>, were <a href="../unused-content">unused</a> characters banished to the Infinite Field. When <a href="Abusari">Abusari</a> changed the Chapter order by making The Hotel Kaiola its own chapter, the barrier between the Infinite Field and the rest of Urrezko Kaiola thinned enough that <a href="Simulacra-1337">Simulacra-1337</a>'s ability could take himself, along with Basati, Zelatatu, and Tximista, into the game proper.</p>
<p>Tximista is a minor antagonist under Ross Bot in Chapter Four, along with <a href="Haizea">Haizea</a>, Zelatatu, and Basati.</p>
<p>Tximista is a major antagonist in Chapter Five, having a side plot centered around her claiming Lehiakide for herself.</p>
<p>Tximista has a boss fight in Chapter Six, where she gains the Hyper Shield ability. If the party fails to defeat Tximista, Ross Bot will fight her instead.</p>
<p>She rejoins Ross Bot's crew in Chapter Seven, and has a boss fight during Lehiakide's questline.
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Tximista's Unique Ability, control over lightning, allows her to deal insane amounts of damage in a single hit, despite her abysmal stats otherwise. She could deal enough damage to kill Basati, Zelatatu, or an Avatar in one hit. The same strike only inconvenienced Simulacra-1337, but this is likely because of his greater durability and not Tximista's lack of damage-dealing.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>Lehiakide</h3>
<p>Originally planned to be Lehiakide's love interest in a bonus mode starring them, Tximista (and the bonus mode) were scrapped early into development. When Tximista escaped the Infinite Field with the help of Simulacra-1337, due to her incomplete programming, Tximista began pursuing Lehiakide single-mindedly. Lehiakide views Tximista as a menace, and is more than a little bit creeped out by her advances, once they start to notice them at all.</p>
<h3>Simulacra-1337</h3>
<p>Tximista served Ross Bot. Unlike Basati and Zelatatu, however, Tximista took the first chance to turn against him and run.</p>
<h3>Haizea and Izoztutako</h3>
<p><a href="Izoztutako">Izoztutako</a>, Haizea, and Tximista are friends, and the latter two helped Izoztutako fight the Solvers.</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Due to Tximista being from a scrapped bonus mode, some <a href="../unused-content">unused features</a> can be activated through her prescence, specifically the ability to switch perspective to another character and control them without an Avatar present.</li>
  <li>All of the titles of Tximista's themes make reference to her <em>yandere</em> tendencies.</li>
