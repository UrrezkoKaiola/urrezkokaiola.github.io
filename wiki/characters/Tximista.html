<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Tximista is cripplingly shy, but also capable of a lot of harm. She is also an archetypical <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">yandere</a>; single-mindedly devoted to the object of her affections (Lehiakide) and violent when those affections are refused or her percieved chances threatened.</p>
<h2>Story</h2>
<p>Tximista, along with Basati and Zelatatu, were <a href="../unused-content">unused</a> characters banished to the Infinite Field. When Abusari changed the Chapter order by making The Hotel Kaiola its own chapter, the barrier between the Infinite Field and the rest of Urrezko Kaiola thinned enough that Simulacra-1337's ability could take himself, along with Basati, Zelatatu, and Tximista, into the game proper.</p>
<p>Tximista is a minor antagonist under Ross Bot in Chapter Four, along with Haizea, Zelatatu, and Basati.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Tximista's Unique Ability, control over lightning, allows her to deal insane amounts of damage in a single hit, despite her abysmal stats otherwise. She could deal enough damage to kill Basati, Zelatatu, or an Avatar in one hit. The same strike only inconvenienced Simulacra-1337, but this is likely because of his greater durability and not Tximista's lack of damage-dealing.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>Lehiakide</h3>
<p>Originally planned to be Lehiakide's love interest in a bonus mode starring them, Tximista (and the bonus mode) were scrapped early into development. When Tximista escaped the Infinite Field with the help of Simulacra-1337, due to her incomplete programming, Tximista began pursuing Lehiakide single-mindedly. Lehiakide views Tximista as a menace, and is more than a little bit creeped out by her advances, once they start to notice them at all.</p>
<h3>Simulacra-1337</h3>
<p>Tximista served Ross Bot. Unlike Basati and Zelatatu, however, Tximista took the first chance to turn against him and run.</p>
<h3>Haizea and Izoztutako</h3>
<p>Izoztutako, Haizea, and Tximista are friends, and the latter two helped Izoztutako fight the Solvers.</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Due to Tximista being from a scrapped bonus mode, some <a href="../unused-content">unused features</a> can be activated through her prescence, specifically the ability to switch perspective to another character and control them without an Avatar present.</li>
  <li>All of the titles of Tximista's themes make reference to her <em>yandere</em> tendencies.</li>
