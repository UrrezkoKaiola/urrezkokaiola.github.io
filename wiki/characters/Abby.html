<p><em>For the other character sharing a body with this one, see <a href="akelarre">Akelarre</p>.</em></p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Abby is kind, flirtatious, and gregarious, but also has a hidden venomous side. She is very happy with the Solvers, but if she interacts with someone she dislikes (e.g. <a href ="Kara">Kara</a>, <a href="Izoztutako">Izoztutako</a>), she is capable of great vitriol.</p>
<h2>Story</h2>
<p>Abby has a cryptic conversation with the Avatar in Chapter Zero.</p>
<p>In Chapter One, Abby gives the Avatar a Universal Communicator device to talk with her. Abby joins the Avatar's party for the last third of the chapter.<p>
<p>In Chapter Two and Three, she acts as an advisor to the player through the Universal Communicator (joined by Lehiakide in Chapter Three).</p>
<p>In Chapter Four, Abby rejoins the party, and with <a href="Lehiakide">Lehiakide</a>, they fight against <a href="Haizea">Haizea</a>, <a href="Basati">Basati</a>, <a href="Tximista">Tximista</a>, <a href="Zelatatu">Zelatatu</a>, and <a href="Simulacra-1337">Simulacra-1337</a>.</p>
<p>Abby again leaves the party for reasons not entirely clear during Chapter Five.</p>
<p>Abby rejoins the party for Chapter Six.</p>
<p>Abby leaves the party not long into Chapter Seven, and is not seen after the fight with The Band.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Abby's abilities are based on flirtation and infatuation.</p>
<p>Abby's <a href="../unique-ability">Unique Ability</a> causes her to become stronger each Chapter, giving her an exponential power curve greater than any other characters.</p>
<p>Abby can use bows as her weapon of choice, as well as swords.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>Solvers & Avatars</h3>
<p>Abby is very flirtatious with the Solvers and their Avatars. Abby even slept with the Avatar between Chapter One and Two.</p>
<h3>Lance</h3>
<p><a href="Lance">Lance</a> is Abby's second-in-command and trusted confidant, and they work together to achieve their goal of leaving Urrezko Kaiola. It is unknown if their relationship is platonic or romantic.</p>
<h3>Kara</h3>
<p>Abby <em>loathes</em> Kara, and will do anything to annoy or undermine her in order to achieve her goal of leaving Urrezko Kaiola.</p>
<h3>Lehiakide</h3>
<p>Despite being specifically weak to most of her abilities, Lehiakide is friendly with Abby. Abby's flirtatious personality causes some problems when interacting with Lehiakide, however.</p>
<h3>Simulacra-1337</h3>
<p>Simulacra-1337 and Abby share a hard-to-define romantic relationship. Abby is the only game character who Simulacra-1337 actually respects, and he will go out of his way to exclude her when insulting game characters in general. In turn, Abby is one of a few game characters willing to tolerate him.</p>
<h3>Izoztutako</h3>
<p><a href="Izoztutako">Izoztutako</a> is second only to Kara on Abby's shit list. She really does not like her.</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Abby is one of three characters to not have a Basque name, and the only one whose name has no deeper meaning.</li>
  <li>Abby's Class title, Maitalea, means 'lover'.</li>
