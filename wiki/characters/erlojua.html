<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Erlojua is a ruthless ruler, although she does have a much more silly personality than her servant/girlfriend <a href="ilargia">Ilargia</a>.</p>
<h2>Story</h2>
<p>Erlojua is not seen through most of the chapter, only through commanding Ilargia and vauge mentions. When the party gets to ClockMoon Mansion, however, they see Erlojua and all of her powers as the final boss of the chapter.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Erlojua's <a href="../unique-ability">Unique Ability</a> allows her to bend the flow of time around herself. In practice, this allows her to create clones of herself that have the same strength as her, and can dissapear at any time. These aren't truly clones like the ones made with the Clone skill, however, because they <em>are</em> actually Erlojua, but from alternate pasts and futures bent into our timeline.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>Ilargia</h3>
<p>Ilargia is Erlojua's devoted servant, and together they make up the Hands of Time. Offending one is a sure-fire way to earn the rage of the other. They're also romantically involved, although the exact nature of this is unclear.</p>
<h3>Basati</h3>
<p>Erlojua revived <a href="Basati">Basati</a> as a thrall for the purpose of having extra manpower. This new Basati is totally loyal to Erlojua.</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<ul>
<li>Erlojua's dialouge contains many lines and references to the musical <em>Hamilton</em>.</li>
<li>Erlojua and Ilargia have acessories matching each other's hair colors.</li>
</ul>
