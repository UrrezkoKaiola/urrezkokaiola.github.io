<h2>Personality</h2>
<p><span style="color:#c72e51">The Catboy Whose Name Leaves No Lips</span> is kind and affable, except when dealing with Izoztutako (see Relationships).</p>
<h2>Story</h2>
<p><span style="color:#c72e51">The Pinket</span> is first seen following after a fight with Izoztutako in Chapter Six. <span style="color:#c72e51">He Whose Name is Infohazardous</span> then fights the players.</p>
<p><span style="color:#c72e51">The Nameless One</span> (okay, now you're just pushing it) is a recruitable party member in Chapter Six, and can help you fight.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As you may have guessed, <span style="color:#c72e51">The Snarky Royal Attendant</span>'s Unique Ability prevents his name from being spoken aloud or in text. This even extends to the interface of the game itself. He requires a conscious effort to stop the ability from working, and so doesn't ever turn it off. Iklusea is capable of bypassing this ability for unknown reasons.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>Izoztutako</h3>
<p>Izoztutako and <span style="color:#c72e51">He Of The Red Doors</span> are romantically involved. Due to their clashing personalities, though, this almost always creates bickering-flirting shouting matches between them. He has an affectionate nickname for her, "Ice Bitch". Only he is allowed to call her that, at least according to her.</p>
<h3>Euritsu</h3>
<p><span style="color:#c72e51">Rose-Haired Kitty</span> and I are siblings. We get along just fine, but his ability does cause me problems. See the pink text.</p>
