<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Abusari was a formal and polite hotel owner. He had a low tolerance for bad behavior in his hotel, and did most things he did to maintain the hotel's image.</p>
<h2>Story</h2>
<p>Abusari and his Hotel Kaiola were originally not the focus of a Chapter at all, instead being a sidequest in The Spooky Chapter (originally Four, currently Five). However, Abusari modified the game in order to make The Hotel Kaiola a chapter unto itself, thereby creating Chapter Three as we know it, changing the Chapter order entirely, and causing a number of unforseen consequences, including <a href="Simulacra-1337">Simulcra-1337</a>, <a href="Basati">Basati</a>, <a href="Tximista">Tximista</a>, and <a href="Zelatatu">Zelatatu</a> being introduced (reintroduced, for the latter three) into the world.</p>
<p>During Chapter Three, Abusari watches as you explore the Hotel Kaiola, but he only intervenes once you reach the off-limits Fourth Floor. With the ability Hyper Shield (gifted by Izoztutako), Abusari gained the confidence to fight despite his very low stats. Unfortunately for him, <a href="Simulacra=7779">Simulacra-7779</a> placed anti-Hyper Shield items earlier in the Chapter to make it possible to complete. Abusari met his end at the hands of the players.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Abusari would not be able to fight at all under normal circumstances; even a Level 1 player would be a match for him. However, with Hyper Shield, he could successfully challenge the player, if only to stall them.</p>
<p>Abusari's Unique Ability allowed him to redact any information leaving the Urrezko Kaiola world that contained information he did not want to be seen. Abusari used this ability extensively to prevent Abby, Lehiakide, and the Avatars from interfering in his plans, especially from revealing his secondary ability.</p>
<p>Abusari had another strange (non-Unique) ability: he could shapeshift. During the Chapter, he used this to transform himself into Abby. It is unknown how this ability was achieved.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3><a href="Abby">Abby</a>, <a href="Lance">Lance</a>, and <a href="Lehiakide">Lehiakide</a></h3>
<p>These three were banned from the Hotel Kaiola for reasons that are not known.</p>
<h3><a href="Izoztutako">Izoztutako</a></h3>
<p>She granted him the Hyper Shield ability as a 'social expiriment'.</p>
<h3><a href="Euritsu">Euritsu</a></h3>
<p>Abusari never met me, but his callous use of his Unique Ability caused me lots of trouble. I didn't like him.</p>
