<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Loratzen's personality and intentions are currently unknown.</p>
<h2>Story</h2>
<p>Loratzen teaches the player about Mega Skills when she encounters them in Chapter Seven. She then joins the party without asking. After the first battle with The Band, she disappears.</p>
<p>During Chapter Eight, Loratzen makes herself a selectable option character. However, this makes completing the chapter impossible.</p>
<p>Loratzen is fought once in Chapter Eight, and again optionally if you choose to impede her progress into Oihaneko Erregea's palace.</p>
<p>If the player chose to not impede Loratzen, the Avatar will read Oihaneko Erregea's diary and reveal the truth to him right in front of Ezetxalotua, his love. If the player instead chose to impede Loratzen, Loratzen breaks into the throne room and delivers the same information.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Loratzen has extensive mastery over her Unique Ability, and can use her Element in an amount of ways other elementalists cannot compare to. She is an incredibly strong fighter.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>Erretzen</h3>
<p>Before the memory erasure, Loratzen and Erretzen had a vaguely romantic relationship, but afterwards their relationship is significantly (more) fraught.</p>
<h3>Oihaneko Erregea</h3>
<p>Loratzen hates the so-called Jungle King, and set about a plan that would lead to his defeat.</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<ul><li>Loratzen is the first character, besides The Avatars, to be playable immediately after their introduction.</li></ul>
