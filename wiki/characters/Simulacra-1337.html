<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Simulacra-1337 is rude, foulmouthed, and overall a real asshole. <span style="color:#666666">i aint rude i just got opinions your ass dont seem to like</span> He has a particular dislike for humans and <a href="../game-character-species">Game Characters</a> (except Abby). He is scared of nothing except Ross Blackwood, the human which he is based upon.</p>
<h2>Story</h2>
<p>Ross Bot is the main antagonist of Chapter Four, having taken over that role from Haizea.</p>
<p>He appears in Chapter Five, seeking revenge against Tximista (for killing Basati and Zelatatu, and for crashing his shack). His tank-attack coincidentally saves Lehiakide from Tximista's yandere-based insanity.</p>
<p>He appears again in Chapter Six, again seeking to fight Tximista. <span style="color:#666666">damn right i reappeared in chapter 6, stupid ass solvers couldnt bust her ass without my help so i had to give her stupid blonde ass the belt</span> This time, he allows the player to control him briefly.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Simulacra-1337's Unique Ability allows him to destroy any and all cyber-security measure. Given that Urrezko Kaiola is an entirely digital world, this might very well be the strongest Unique Ability in existence. This allows him to freely enter and leave Urrezko Kaiola without Kara's permission (something no one else can do) and to break into any file or server he wants to.</p>
<p>Simulacra-1337's primary weapon is not his (impressive) stats and skills, but his extradimensional shack, <span style="color:#666666">the fuck you mean extradimensional my shack is a work of fuckin art</span> which has many abilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Teleportation between the Urrezko Kaiola world and the internet, or the human world.</li>
  <li>The ability to transform into a tank, and possibly other vehicles.</li>
  <li>When in tank form, ramming someone or something for millions of damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Simulacra-1337 also has the unique aesthetic ability to add comments to any skill he uses, which are usually rude.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>Abby</h3>
<p>Simulacra-1337 and Abby share a hard-to-define romantic relationship. Abby is the only game character who Simulacra-1337 actually respects, and he will go out of his way to exclude her when insulting game characters in general. In turn, Abby is one of a few game characters willing to tolerate him.</p>
<h3>Kara</h3>
<p>Simulacra-1337 intensely dislikes Kara, and likes trolling her. He especially likes calling her a fairy (she's an angel) to get under her skin. <span style="color:#666666">kara is a bitch and she can kiss my grey ass</span></p>
<h3>Basati</h3>
<p>Basati served Ross Bot, and seemed to enjoy it.</p>
<h3>Zelatatu</h3>
<p>Zelatatu served Ross Bot, and had no complaints about doing so. <span style="color:#666666">the fuck you mean no complaints all of them muthafuckas loved me except when that dumb bitch txmista killed em all, stupid bitch</span></p>
<h3>Tximista</h3>
<p>Tximista served Ross Bot. Unlike Basati and Zelatatu, however, Tximista took the first chance to turn against him and run.</p>
<h3>Haizea</h3>
<p>Haizea absolutely hates Ross Bot, and he hates her in turn. <span style="color:#666666">haizea is a stupid flat chested bitch, its always the flat ones that gotta go and fuckin cause problems i mean youd think they got all that shit off their chest but no Abby forbid that, fuckin problematic ass bitches</span></p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Simulacra-1337 is one of only two characters (the other being Lehiakide) to have been controlled by Solvers without an Avatar present. This situation was only possible because Tximista still has code left over from the scrapped bonus mode starring Lehiakide.</li>
  <li>The word 'simulacra' is plural, the singular is 'simulacrum'. However, Simulacra (referring to the species) is both singular and plural.</li>
