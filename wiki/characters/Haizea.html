<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Haizea is normally fairly affable, but when annoyed, which is often, she becomes something of a bitch.</p>
<h2>Story</h2>
<p>Haizea was intended to be the primary antagonist of Chapter Four (originally Three), but was kicked out of that position by Simulacra-1337 and his minions Basati, Zelatatu, and Tximista. Subsequently, Haizea became a fairly minor character in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<p>Haizea returns in Chapter Six, now helping out Izoztutako.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Haizea's Unique Ability allows her unparalleled control over the wind. Some unique applications of this include flight and forcing fight to end early by blowing away one of the combatants.</p>
<p>Haizea also has a golden Super Form, known as Super Haizea. This ability is apparently activated by yelling for a really long time.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>Simulacra-1337</h3>
<p>Haizea absolutely hates Ross Bot, and he hates her in turn.</p>
<h3>Tximista and Izoztutako</h3>
<p>Izoztutako, Haizea, and Tximista are friends, and the latter two helped Izoztutako fight the Solvers.</p>
<h3>Iruzurra</h3>
<p>Iruzurra dislikes Haizea because of how she ran the Sky Realm.</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Haizea's Super Form is based off of similar transformations in <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> and <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>, and a common meme about transformations in the former series being activated by yelling.</li>
  <li>Despite being a queen, Haizea only had one subject: Iruzurra. He soon left.</li>
</ul>
