<h2>Story</h2>
<p>Arrosa first appears chasing after Erretzen in the first area of Chapter Eight and introduces himself to the players after Erretzen runs away.</p>
<p>Throughout the chapter, he can be befriended by the player, or not.</p>
<p>At the end of the chapter, if he is befriended, he will attempt to sacrifice himself to save the player from Oihaneko Erregea. In most cases, he is stopped by another character, but if he is not stopped, he dies to little avail.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>

<h3>Oihaneko Erregea</h3>
<p>He was initially loyal to the Jungle King, but after witnessing his actions in the finale of the chapter chose to turn against him.</p>
