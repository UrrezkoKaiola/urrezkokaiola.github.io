<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Erretzen, like her element, is hotheaded
<h2>Story</h2>
<p>Erretzen was once one of the Three Queens along with Haizea and Izoztutako. Sometime between Chapter Three and Chapter Eight, her kingdom was overthrown by the pretender known as Oihaneko Erregea, real name <a href=simulacra8888>Simulacra-8888</a>, and the memories of her and her subjects were erased to reflect this change in leadership.</p>
<p>She is now titled as 'the Magician' and is a renegade on the run from the usurper's rule.</p>
<p>In most endings of Chapter Eight, Ashton Bot is overthrown, but Erretzen does not take the Jungle Throne, that position instead being held by Ross Bot.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>Loratzen</h3>
<p>Erretzen and Loratzen were romantically involved (if in a fraught way similarly to Izoztutako and <span style="color:#c72e51">that catboy's</span> relationship) before the memory erasure. Afterwards, their relationship became significantly more complicated. After some emotional interactions, they seem to be reconciled to some degree, however.</p>
