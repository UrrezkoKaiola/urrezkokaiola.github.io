<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Iruzurra is greedy, and will do anything to obtain money. He will go to almost any end to do this.</p>
<h2>Story</h2>
<p>In Chapter Four, Iruzurra introduces himself when the player enters the Sky Realm.</p>
<p>Iruzurra continues acting as a shopkeeper further on in Chapter Five and Six.</p>
<p>Iruzurra battles the player when they attempt to enter the Jatetxe Ona Pizzeria.</p>
<p>At one point in chapter Six, Iruzurra opens a 'toll water lane'. If the player is charged four times to go through this lane, <a href="Kara">Kara</a> appears and attacks Iruzurra, disabling the toll water lane.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Iruzurra's <a href="../unique-ability">Unique Ability</a> allows him to do anything a video game shopkeeper can. He is nearly unkillable because many video games don't allow you to kill shopkeepers. He can access nearly every skill (through the 'Metronome' skill) and effect (through the 'Surprise Me' skill) because he can sell nearly anything. He seems to be able to be in multiple places at once, but it is not known whether this is what he's actually doing or if he just quickly teleports to follow the player.</p>
<p>Iruzurra has a recurring option called 'Surprise Me' which can cause any number of teleportation or interface-screwing effects to the player.</p>
<p>Iruzurra's Unique Ability makes him incredibly powerful, but at the cost of being a passive player.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>Kara</h3>
<p>Iruzurra dislikes Kara due to her interference in the economy. At one point, she attacks him for running a toll scam.</p>
<h3>Haizea</h3>
<p>Iruzurra dislikes <a href="Haizea">Haizea</a> because of how she ran the Sky Realm.</p>
<h3>Amorratu</h3>
<p><a href="Amorratu">Amorratu</a> does not like Iruzurra because he sells his pizza at a markup and uses mafia-like tactics to maintain this arrangement.</p>
