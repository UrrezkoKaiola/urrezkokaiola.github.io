<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Lehiakide is an archetypical <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">tsundere</a>. They are rude, foulmouthed, and ornery, but occasionally reveal a softer side. They have a character weakness to affection, evident when they can be defeated with a few uses of the (initially) unused skill Flirt in Chapter Two. This character weakness also somewhat extends to sexuality in general, as evinced when Iklusea strips during the second phase of her optional boss fight in Chapter Five.</p>
<h2>Story</h2>
<p>Lehiakide is the primary antagonist of Chapter Two. Lehiakide was always going to be the antagonist of the Desert Chapter, but interacting with the Solvers made them decide to increase the difficulty of their chapter immensely, including importing The Mansion from four chapters later (Chapter Six) and increasing their own stats massively.</p>
<p>In the fifth and final battle with Lehiakide in Chapter Two, Abby gives the Avatar access to the unused skill Flirt, which allows the Avatar to defeat Lehiakide non-violently (see Personality). Lehiakide can be defeated non-violently here.</p>
<p>When Lehiakide appears in Chapter Three, they are experiencing a depressive mood brought about by being defeated. At this point, their hair has been changed. Lehiakide adds themself to the Avatar's Universal Communicator, allowing them to be contacted throughout the Chapter, along with Abby.</p>
<p>Lehiakide is recruited as a party member in Chapter Four, where they help the Avatar and Abby fight
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Lehiakide's signature skill is Backup Bash, a powerful physical strike that has a 15% chance to hit.</p>
<p>Lehiakide's other abilities include Bedazzle, Thunderbolt, and Hyperspeed.</p>
<p>Their weapons of choice are kunai, which allow them many attacks per turn.</p>
<p>Lehiakide's <a href="../unique-ability">Unique Ability</a> is not known, but they do have one.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h4>Solvers & Avatars</h4>
<p>Lehiakide has a love-hate relationship with the Solvers, and by extension the Avatars they control.</p>
<h4>Abby</h4>
<p>Despite being specifically weak to most of her abilities, Lehiakide is friendly with Abby. Abby's flirtatious personality causes some problems when interacting with Lehiakide, however.</p>
<h4>Tximista</h4>
<p>Originally planned to be Lehiakide's love interest in a bonus mode starring them, Tximista (and the bonus mode) were scrapped early into development. When Tximista escaped the Infinite Field with the help of Simulacra-1337, due to her incomplete programming, Tximista began pursuing Lehiakide single-mindedly. Lehiakide views Tximista as a menace, and is more than a little bit creeped out by her advances, once they start to notice them at all.</p>
