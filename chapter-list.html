<p>
[1] Areas from the original Chapter 6 were moved into this Chapter.<br>
[2] The 'new' Chapter 3 didn't exist before except as an optional area in the old chapter 5.<br>
[3] We don't know what, if anything, is in the modified chapter 5.<br>
[4] Given several areas were forcibly removed from this chapter, expect it to be very different.<br>
[5] We actually don't know what is in these chapters. Assume for the time being that they're at least similar to the original chapter title.<br>
[6] No clue about this one except for the fact that it exists, at least according to Kara's unreliable testimony.
